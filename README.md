# 🏗️ Bulldozer Sale Price Prediction

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict the sale price of bulldozers using historical auction data. By leveraging a **Random Forest Regressor** from Scikit-Learn and preprocessing tools from Pandas and NumPy, the model aims to deliver accurate price predictions that can help sellers and buyers make informed decisions.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal is to develop a regression model that predicts the **sale price of a bulldozer** at auction based on various features like model, year of manufacture, usage, and more.

### 💡 Why This Project?

Heavy machinery like bulldozers are high-investment items, and accurately predicting their resale value can save or earn thousands of dollars. By analyzing patterns in past auction data, we can train a model that offers reliable price estimates.
